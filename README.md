## Let's enhance the digital literacy and critical thinking in today's information-driven society

#### INTRODUCTION


* The Clickbait Fake News Detection System is a web-based application designed to analyze and identify clickbait articles from various sources. With the increasing spread of misinformation and sensationalized content, this system aims to provide users with a reliable tool to distinguish between genuine news and clickbait.

* The project leverages machine learning techniques and natural language processing algorithms to detect patterns and characteristics commonly associated with clickbait articles. By analyzing the article's content, headline, and other relevant factors, the system provides a prediction of whether the article is likely to be clickbait or not.
The system's user-friendly interface allows users to submit articles for analysis and receive real-time results. Additionally, users can provide feedback on the accuracy of the system's predictions, which helps improve its performance over time.

* By utilizing advanced technologies and algorithms, the Clickbait Fake News Detection System aims to assist users in making informed decisions about the credibility and reliability of the news articles they encounter online. The project not only addresses the challenges of combating clickbait but also contributes to the larger goal of promoting digital literacy and critical thinking in today's 
information-driven society.  

* Overall, the Clickbait Fake News Detection System is a valuable tool that empowers users to navigate the online news landscape with confidence and trust in the authenticity of the information they consume.

## Installation
-	**Set up the Server**
*	Ensure that you have a server or hosting environment with a compatible operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) and necessary configurations (e.g., web server, database server).
- **Install Required Software**
*	Install Python: Check if Python is already installed on the server by running `python3 --version`. If Python is not installed, install it using the appropriate package manager for your operating system.
*	Install Django: Run `pip3 install django` to install Django, the Python web framework.
*	Install `Node.js` and `npm`: Follow the official `Node.js` installation guide to install `Node.js` and `npm`, which will be needed for frontend dependencies and build processes.
- **Configure the Database**
*	install a database management system `MySQL` on your server.
*	Configure Django's database settings in the `settings.py` file of your project to connect to the database.
-	**Clone the Project**
*	Use a version control system (e.g., Git) `git clone "git@github.com:stoicism-sympathei/Fake-News-Detection-System.git"`.
-	**Install Project Dependencies**
*	Backend: Navigate to the project directory and run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python libraries and dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
*	Frontend: Navigate to the frontend directory within the project and run npm install to install the necessary frontend dependencies.
-	**Build the Frontend Assets**
*	In the frontend directory, run npm run build to build the frontend assets and generate the static files.
- **Run Database Migrations**
*	Apply database migrations to set up the necessary database tables by running `python3 manage.py` migrate in the project directory.
- **Collect Static Files**
*	Run `python3 manage.py` collectstatic to collect static files into a single directory.
- **Configure Web Server**
*	Set up a web server `Nginx` to serve the static files and proxy dynamic requests to the Django backend.
*	Configure the web server to forward requests to the Gunicorn WSGI server, which will run the Django application.
- **Start the Application**
*	Start the Gunicorn server by running `gunicorn clickbait_fake_news_detection_system.wsgi` in the project directory.
*	Configure the Gunicorn server to run as a background process or use process management tools like Supervisor or systemd.
-	**Test the Deployment**
*	Access your Clickbait Fake News Detection System application through the server's IP address or domain name in a web browser.
*	Verify that the application is running and functioning correctly.
